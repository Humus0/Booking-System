# Booking-System

## Description:
I developed a booking system that allows users to schedule and secure appointments in advance. On the booking page, users can enter their personal details along with the desired date and time for their booking. On the admin page, administrators can search for a booking by entering a reference number and update the booking status from "unassigned" to "assigned." Additionally, if no reference number is entered, the system displays all bookings scheduled within the next two hours.
